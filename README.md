Conclusion

In this analysis, we looked at standardized test results in reading and math for high school students (grades 9 - 12) in a large school district. The population consisted of every single high school student in the district. Our data also included information about school size and school budget.   

   Based on the data, we can see that the percentage of students passing math in standardized tests is lower than the percentage passing reading for all schools in the district and significantly lower in bottom performing schools, where the percentage difference is around 15%. As such, it may be prudent to increase the resources used for math education or re-evaluate the math curriculum. More in depth analysis would be required to determine the best course of action.
   
   Charter school students in this district are also better performers on standardized tests than district school students, both in overall standardized test performance as a group and on a per school basis: the top five performing schools in the district are charter schools and the bottom five performing schools are district schools. This does not seem to be due to higher funding for charter schools, as the average per student budget for charter schools is lower than the average per student budget for district schools. Significant research into other differences between these two groups could facilitate understanding the reasons for this divergence, including pupils per teacher, school and class structure, etc.
   
   Finally, this analysis suggests the optimum school size for best performance on standardized tests to be between 1000 and 2000 students. This conclusion is severely limited by the information available for this analysis, however, conducting more research into school size and performance could lead to robust evidence to support the implementation of requirements for schools in this size range.
